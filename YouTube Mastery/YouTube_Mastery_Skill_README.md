## How It Works

### Automatic Framework Selection

The skill intelligently determines which framework(s) to load based on the user's query:

**User says:** "I need a video idea about AI tools"
→ Loads `ideation_framework.md` for research and validation process

**User says:** "Help me write a compelling title"
→ Loads `titles_thumbnails_framework.md` for packaging strategy

**User says:** "My viewers drop off after 10 seconds"
→ Loads `intro_framework.md` for expectation alignment

**User says:** "How do I keep people watching?"
→ Loads `retention_framework.md` for six-component system

**User says:** "What editing techniques should I use?"
→ Loads `editing_framework.md` for four-pillar formula

### Integration with Existing Skills

**With content-outlining:**
1. Use YouTube ideation to identify popular areas
2. Use outlining to create WBS structure
3. Apply green/purple formula to outline
4. Validate sections can be packaged compellingly

**With scriptwriting/human-writing:**
1. Use retention framework for structure
2. Use scriptwriting for natural dialogue
3. Use human-writing for authentic voice
4. Plan for visuals/sound during writing

**With project-management:**
1. Use stakeholder-analysis for deep audience understanding
2. Use scope-management for video/series definition
