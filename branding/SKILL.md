# Branding

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive frameworks and methodologies for developing, documenting, and implementing cohesive brand identities that encompass visual design, messaging, tone of voice, and implementation guidelines.

## Workflow Decision Tree

To determine the appropriate branding workflow:

```
Is this a new brand creation?
├── YES → Start with "Brand Foundation Development"
│   └── Then proceed to "Identity System Creation"
└── NO → Is this a brand refresh/evolution?
    ├── YES → Begin with "Brand Audit & Assessment"
    │   └── Then proceed to "Identity System Creation"
    └── NO → Is this brand implementation?
        ├── YES → Go to "Implementation & Application"
        └── NO → Use "Brand Governance & Management"
```

## Brand Foundation Development

### Discovery Process

To establish brand foundations, conduct systematic discovery through four key areas:

#### 1. Organizational Analysis
Gather and document:
- Mission, vision, and core values
- Unique value propositions and differentiators
- Strategic objectives and business goals
- Organizational culture and beliefs
- Historical context and heritage

#### 2. Audience Research
Define and analyze:
- **Primary Audiences**: Core user segments with detailed personas
- **Secondary Audiences**: Stakeholders, influencers, and partners
- **Psychographic Profiles**: Values, motivations, and lifestyle factors
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Decision-making processes and preferences
- **Communication Preferences**: Channels, formats, and frequency

#### 3. Competitive Landscape
Evaluate and map:
- Direct competitors and their positioning
- Indirect competitors and market alternatives
- White space opportunities for differentiation
- Industry conventions to embrace or challenge
- Best practices from adjacent industries

#### 4. Positioning Strategy

To develop brand positioning, use this framework:

```
For [target audience]
Who [statement of need/opportunity]
[Brand name] is [product/service category]
That [key benefit/differentiator]
Unlike [primary competitive alternative]
[Brand name] [primary differentiation]
```

**Example Application:**
```
For educators creating online courses
Who need to make complex topics accessible
EduCraft is an AI-powered platform
That transforms expertise into engaging learning experiences
Unlike traditional course builders
EduCraft uses AI to optimize content for learning outcomes
```

## Identity System Creation

### Visual Identity Development

#### Logo System Architecture

To create a comprehensive logo system, develop:

1. **Primary Mark Components**
   - Full logo with all elements
   - Clear space formula (minimum = x-height of typography)
   - Minimum sizes: Digital (120px), Print (0.5 inches)
   - Maximum sizes and scaling rules

2. **Logo Variations Matrix**
   ```
   Format        | Full Color | Monochrome | Reversed
   --------------|------------|------------|----------
   Horizontal    | ✓          | ✓          | ✓
   Vertical      | ✓          | ✓          | ✓
   Icon Only     | ✓          | ✓          | ✓
   With Tagline  | ✓          | ✓          | ✓
   ```

3. **Usage Guidelines**
   - Acceptable color backgrounds (specify RGB/HEX ranges)
   - Prohibited alterations checklist
   - Co-branding lockup specifications
   - Digital optimization requirements

#### Color System Development

To establish a color system, create three tiers:

1. **Primary Palette (2-3 colors maximum)**
   ```
   Color Name: [Descriptive Name]
   HEX: #000000
   RGB: 0, 0, 0
   CMYK: 0, 0, 0, 100
   Pantone: Black C
   Usage: Primary brand identification
   Accessibility: WCAG AA/AAA compliance ratios
   ```

2. **Secondary Palette (4-6 supporting colors)**
   - Accent colors for emphasis
   - Functional colors (success: green, warning: amber, error: red)
   - Neutral grays for typography and UI
   - Tints and shades for depth

3. **Application Rules**
   - 60-30-10 rule for color distribution
   - Text/background combination matrix
   - Gradient specifications if applicable
   - Cultural consideration notes

#### Typography System

To create typography hierarchy, establish:

1. **Type Scale Using Modular Ratio (1.25 - Major Third)**
   ```
   Display:  48px / 3rem    - Headlines
   H1:       38.4px / 2.4rem - Page titles  
   H2:       30.7px / 1.92rem - Section headers
   H3:       24.6px / 1.54rem - Subsections
   Body:     20px / 1.25rem  - Content
   Small:    16px / 1rem     - Captions
   ```

2. **Font Specifications**
   - Display typeface + fallback stack
   - Body typeface + fallback stack  
   - Monospace for code/data
   - Web font loading strategy

3. **Typography Rules**
   - Line height: 1.5 for body, 1.2 for headlines
   - Paragraph spacing: 1em
   - Letter spacing adjustments for caps
   - Maximum line length: 65-75 characters

### Messaging Framework

#### Brand Voice Architecture

To define brand voice, establish personality on these spectrums:

```
Formal ←────────●───→ Conversational
Technical ←──────●─────→ Accessible  
Serious ←─────●──────→ Playful
Reserved ←────●─────→ Bold
```

#### Content Principles

To guide content creation, define:

1. **Writing Style Guidelines**
   - Sentence structure (simple, compound, complex balance)
   - Active voice preference (aim for 80%+)
   - Technical terminology handling
   - Inclusive language standards

2. **Content Patterns Library**
   ```
   Headlines: [Action Verb] + [Value Proposition]
   CTAs: [Verb] + [Specific Outcome]
   Error Messages: [What happened] + [Why] + [How to fix]
   Success Messages: [Confirmation] + [Next step]
   ```

## Implementation & Application

### Digital Applications

#### Web & Mobile Standards

To implement digital branding, specify:

1. **Component System**
   ```
   Components/
   ├── Atoms (buttons, inputs, labels)
   ├── Molecules (cards, forms, nav items)
   ├── Organisms (headers, sections, footers)
   └── Templates (page layouts)
   ```

2. **Interaction Principles**
   - Hover states and transitions (duration: 200-300ms)
   - Loading and progress indicators
   - Animation easing functions
   - Micro-interaction patterns

3. **Responsive Behavior**
   - Breakpoints: 320, 768, 1024, 1440px
   - Scaling ratios for typography
   - Image optimization strategies
   - Touch target minimums (44x44px)

#### Social Media Adaptation

To maintain brand across platforms, create:

1. **Platform Templates**
   ```
