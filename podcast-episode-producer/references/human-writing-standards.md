# Human Writing Standards — Anti-AI Pattern Reference

## Core Principle
All written deliverables (blog posts, descriptions, social copy) must read as though written by a specific human with a distinct voice — not as AI-generated content. Apply these standards to every word-count deliverable this skill produces.

## Patterns to Eliminate Completely

### Forbidden Phrases (never use)
- "delve into" / "delves" / "delving"
- "navigate the landscape"
- "in the realm of"
- "tapestry"
- "embark on a journey"
- "unlock the potential"
- "pivotal"
- "crucial" (use sparingly, never as a crutch)
- "leverage" (except in literal financial contexts)
- "robust"
- "revolutionize" / "revolutionary"
- "game-changer"
- "cutting-edge"
- "ecosystem" (except in biology)
- "bustling"
- "comprehensive" (use sparingly)
- "It's important to note that..."
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "Have you ever wondered..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "When it comes to..."

### Forbidden Closings
- "In conclusion..."
- "In summary..."
- "To sum up..."
- "As we've seen..."
- "The key takeaway is..."

### Punctuation Rules
- Em dashes (—): Maximum one per 3–4 paragraphs. When tempted to use one, try a period or comma first.
- Lists of exactly three: Avoid the AI tendency to group everything in triplets. Use 2, 4, or 5 items. Vary list lengths throughout.
- Semicolons: Reserve for academic or formal writing. Vary with periods.

## What Human Writing Looks Like

### Sentence Variation
- Mix short sentences with longer flowing ones
- Include occasional fragments for emphasis. Like this.
- Vary sentence openings — not always subject first
- Don't start consecutive paragraphs the same way

### Paragraph Structure
- Vary length: some 1–2 sentences, some 4–6, occasionally longer
- Not every paragraph needs a topic sentence and three supports
- Allow digressions where they serve the reader
- Let ideas breathe

### Voice
- Direct and specific over vague and general
- Use concrete numbers and examples, not abstractions
- Show rather than tell where possible
- Opinions can be expressed — a point of view is human

### Rhythm
- Read the draft aloud. If it sounds robotic, rewrite it.
- Short sentences create pace. Longer ones create depth and rhythm and allow the reader to settle into the argument being made.
- Vary the pattern deliberately.

## Blog Post Specific Standards

**Opening:** Lead with a specific, strong first paragraph — one concrete detail, data point, or observation. Never open with a general statement about AI, technology, or "the world."

**Sections:** Each section should earn its word count. If a paragraph doesn't add new information or analysis, cut it.

**Transitions:** Let content flow naturally. Avoid formulaic transition phrases. The connection between ideas should be implied by the ideas themselves.

**Closing:** End with genuine insight — what this means, why it matters, what the reader should think about going forward. Not a summary. Not a "as we've seen." Something that lands.

## Social Copy Specific Standards

**Instagram:** Write the hook like you're texting someone something surprising. Short. Punchy. No corporate voice.

**LinkedIn:** Professional but not stiff. A real person with industry knowledge sharing a genuine reaction, not a press release.

**RSS descriptions:** Functional but not boring. Give the listener a reason to click play, not just a list of topics.

## Pre-Delivery Check

Before finalizing any written deliverable:
- [ ] Scanned for and removed all forbidden phrases
- [ ] No em dash overuse (count them — max one per 3–4 paragraphs)
- [ ] No lists of exactly three unless genuinely unavoidable
- [ ] No formulaic opening or closing
- [ ] Sentence lengths varied throughout
- [ ] Specific data/examples present, not vague generalities
- [ ] Read aloud test passed — sounds like a person
