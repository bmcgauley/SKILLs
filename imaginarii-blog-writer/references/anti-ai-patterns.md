# Anti-AI Writing Patterns — Imaginarii Blog Edition

*Adapted from the human-writing skill for Brian McGauley's blog voice specifically.*

## The #1 Tell: Em Dashes

Maximum **one em dash (—) per 3–4 paragraphs.** AI models drastically overuse them.

Alternatives:
- Break into two sentences (most of the time, this is cleaner anyway)
- Use a comma
- Use parentheses for a true aside
- Restructure the sentence

## Forbidden Opening Sentences

Never open a post or section with:
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "In the world of [X]..."
- "Have you ever wondered..."
- "Let's explore..."
- "When it comes to [X]..."
- "It's important to note that..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "Whether [X] or [Y]..."
- "[Topic] is more important than ever."
- "As [X] continues to evolve..."
- "In recent years..."

---

## Forbidden Closings

Never close with:
- "In conclusion..."
- "In summary..."
- "To sum up..."
- "As we've seen..."
- "The key takeaway is..."
- "Whether X or Y, [generic conclusion]"
- "The future of [topic] is bright."
- A restatement of what the post just said

## Structural AI Patterns to Break

### The Rule of Three Addiction
AI compulsively groups things in threes. Vary it:
- Use 2 items, 4 items, or just don't list it
- "clarity, brevity, and authenticity" → "clarity and brevity, with authenticity as the harder-to-teach third"

### Every Section = Same Length
Human writing breathes. Some sections are 2 paragraphs. Some are 6. Mix it.

### Topic Sentence + 3 Supports + Mini-Conclusion
This is the 5-paragraph-essay ghost haunting AI content. Break it. Paragraphs can open with evidence, with a question, with a counterargument. They can be one sentence.

### Transition Overuse
"Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally," "In addition to this," "It's worth noting that," "Notably," — these are scaffolding from a writing class. Real writers let ideas connect without announcing the connection.

## "Week in AI" Specific Anti-Patterns

These patterns make AI recap posts feel like AI recap posts:

**DON'T:** "This week, [Company] announced [thing]. [Company 2] also released [thing2]. Meanwhile, [Company 3] reported [number]. Here's what I think this means."

**DO:** Lead with Brian's observation. Use the news as the evidence. Structure: *observation → companies who prove it → what it means for real people/businesses.*

**DON'T:** Attribute research to AI tools ("Research by Gemini 3.0 Pro") — this is an AdSense policy red flag and undermines credibility.

**DON'T:** Write a chronological summary of the week. That's a newsletter, not a blog post.

**DO:** Find the thesis — the one thing that all this week's AI news is actually evidence of — and build the post around that thesis.

## Imaginarii-Specific Vocabulary to Use Carefully

These words appear in Imaginarii's existing content but are getting repetitive:

- "methodology" — use specifically or not at all
- "philosophy" — once per post max
- "precision" — earned, not decorative
- "structured" — fine, but not every paragraph
- "intentional" — currently AI-coded due to overuse across the web

---

## Voice Check: Read It Aloud

Before delivering, read the draft aloud. Flag:
- Any sentence where you stumble (restructure it)
- Any place where the "voice" suddenly becomes formal or stiff (it went AI — rewrite)
- Any paragraph that sounds like every other blog post on the internet (cut it or make it specific)
