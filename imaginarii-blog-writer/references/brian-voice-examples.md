# Brian McGauley Voice — Before/After Examples

These examples show the target writing style for Imaginarii blog posts.
"Before" = what AI typically produces. "After" = what Imaginarii posts should sound like.

---

## Example 1: Opening a "Week in AI" Post

**BEFORE (AI-style):**
> In this week's AI news roundup, we'll explore the latest developments from major players in the artificial intelligence landscape. It's important to note that several pivotal announcements are reshaping the ecosystem. Let's delve into what happened and what it means for the future.

**Problems:** Generic opener, "landscape", "pivotal", "ecosystem", "delve", "it's important to note", "let's", passive framing throughout.

---

**AFTER (Brian's voice):**
> The consumer AI market just crossed a threshold, and most of the coverage missed it. OpenAI's $1 billion in consumer revenue — people like you and me paying $20/month — isn't the headline. The headline is what that number implies about the next two years.

**Why it works:** Opens with a specific claim and immediately challenges the reader's existing understanding. Uses a real number. States Brian's analytical angle upfront. No filler.

---

## Example 2: Explaining a Technical Concept

**BEFORE (AI-style):**
> Observational memory is a transformative, cutting-edge technique that revolutionizes how AI agents process and retain information. This innovative approach leverages advanced algorithms to seamlessly navigate the complex landscape of context management, enabling more robust and efficient performance.

**Problems:** "transformative", "cutting-edge", "revolutionizes", "innovative", "leverages", "seamlessly", "landscape", "robust" — almost every word is on the banned list.

---

**AFTER (Brian's voice):**
> Until now, AI agents had to re-read entire conversation histories with every new message — like reading the full meeting notes just to remember one decision. Observational memory changes that. Agents store conclusions, not transcripts. The cost drops 10x. That's not incremental improvement; it changes the economic math on what AI agents can viably do.

**Why it works:** Uses a human analogy ("like reading the full meeting notes"). States the mechanism plainly. Gives the real number. Ends with the actual implication, stated directly.

## Example 3: Opening a Regional / Fresno Post

**BEFORE (AI-style):**
> The Central San Joaquin Valley is undergoing a transformative period of unprecedented change, with multifaceted developments reshaping the vibrant community's dynamic landscape. From bustling academic institutions to innovative business sectors, the region is embarking on an exciting journey of evolution.

**Problems:** "transformative", "unprecedented", "multifaceted", "vibrant", "dynamic landscape", "bustling", "embarking", "journey" — this is every banned word in two sentences.

---

**AFTER (Brian's voice):**
> People who don't live here tend to describe Fresno the same way: hot, agricultural, somewhere between LA and SF on the 99. That description was accurate in 1995. What's happening here right now is something different, and it's happening faster than the coverage suggests.

**Why it works:** Acknowledges and then dismantles the clichéd external view. Establishes insider authority without saying "as a local." Creates tension ("faster than the coverage suggests") that makes you want to keep reading.

---

## Example 4: Closing a Post

**BEFORE (AI-style):**
> In conclusion, as we've seen throughout this analysis, the AI industry continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace. The key takeaway is that businesses must remain adaptable and embrace these transformative changes to stay competitive in today's dynamic landscape. Whether you're a startup or an enterprise, the future is bright for those who leverage these innovations.

**Problems:** "In conclusion", "as we've seen", "unprecedented", "key takeaway", "transformative", "today's dynamic landscape", "leverage" — plus it says nothing.

---

**AFTER (Brian's voice):**
> The money is now following the infrastructure, not the demos. Invest your attention accordingly.

**Why it works:** Short. Specific to the post's actual argument. Doesn't rehash. Tells the reader what to do without being prescriptive. Leaves them with something concrete.

## Example 5: Converting a Podcast Script Opening

**PODCAST SCRIPT (raw):**
> Hey everyone, welcome back to the show. Today we're gonna talk about, uh, something that I've been thinking about a lot lately, which is this whole idea that you don't need like a genius idea to start a business, right? Like, a lot of people think that, and I think that's actually holding a lot of people back. So, I want to kind of break that down today...

**BLOG POST OPENING (converted):**
> The "genius idea" myth is one of the most effective ways to avoid ever starting something. It gives you a permanent excuse: "I haven't had *the* idea yet." Meanwhile, Spanx, Slack, and a few hundred other companies you've heard of started because someone got annoyed by something broken and fixed it.

**What changed:** Cut all verbal filler. Moved from "I'm going to talk about" to just *saying the thing*. Found the sharpest version of the argument and led with it. Still Brian's voice — direct, slightly skeptical, grounded in real examples.

## Voice Consistency Checklist

When writing as Brian, ask:

1. **Does this sound like someone who has actually done this?** (Not just read about it)
2. **Would Brian say this out loud?** If it sounds like an essay, it's wrong.
3. **Is there a specific number, name, or example in the first 100 words?** There should be.
4. **Does the opening assume the reader already cares?** Brian doesn't explain why something matters before making his point — he makes his point and the importance is obvious.
5. **Does the ending leave the reader with something?** A decision, a reframing, a single clear action. Not a summary.
