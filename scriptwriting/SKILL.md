# Scriptwriting

## Overview

This skill provides frameworks and methodologies for crafting compelling scripts that sound natural when spoken, engage audiences emotionally, and effectively convey information across various mediums from educational videos to narrative films.

## Script Type Decision Tree

To determine the appropriate scriptwriting approach:

```
What type of script are you creating?
├── EDUCATIONAL/INSTRUCTIONAL
│   ├── Video Tutorial → Use "Educational Video Script"
│   ├── Course Lecture → Use "Lecture Script Format"
│   └── Training Module → Use "Instructional Design Script"
├── PRESENTATION/BUSINESS
│   ├── Keynote/TEDx → Use "Presentation Script"
│   ├── Pitch Deck → Use "Pitch Script Format"
│   └── Webinar → Use "Webinar Script Structure"
├── NARRATIVE/CREATIVE
│   ├── Documentary → Use "Documentary Script"
│   ├── Short Film → Use "Narrative Script Format"
│   └── Commercial → Use "Commercial Script"
└── AUDIO/PODCAST
    ├── Interview → Use "Interview Script Framework"
    ├── Solo Episode → Use "Podcast Monologue"
    └── Narrative Audio → Use "Audio Drama Format"
```

## Core Scriptwriting Principles

### The Spoken Word Difference

Scripts differ fundamentally from written prose because they're meant to be heard, not read. Apply these principles:

1. **Write for the Ear**
   - Short sentences (10-15 words ideal, 20 max)
   - Simple vocabulary unless technical terms necessary
   - Active voice exclusively (passive only for specific effect)
   - Contractions everywhere they'd naturally occur

2. **Natural Speech Patterns**
   - Incomplete sentences where natural
   - Restarts and self-corrections (sparingly)
   - Conversational asides and direct address
   - Rhythm variation to prevent monotony

3. **Clarity Over Cleverness**
   - One idea per sentence
   - Signpost transitions clearly
   - Repeat key points naturally
   - Avoid ambiguous pronouns

### Avoiding AI Script Patterns

**Never use these in scripts:**
- "Let's delve into..." → "Let's look at..." or just start
- "In today's video..." → Jump straight to content
- "Without further ado..." → Delete entirely
- "Comprehensive guide..." → "Complete guide..." or specify
- Triple patterns → Vary list lengths
- Em dashes → Use pauses or new sentences

## Educational Video Scripts

### Structure Framework

#### Hook (0:00-0:10)
Start with one of these patterns:
- **Question Hook**: Pose the exact question viewers have
- **Problem Hook**: Show the frustration they're experiencing
- **Result Hook**: Show the end state they'll achieve
- **Story Hook**: Brief anecdote that sets up the lesson

Example:
```
[WRONG - AI Pattern]
"Welcome to today's comprehensive tutorial where we'll delve into 
the fascinating world of Python programming."

[RIGHT - Natural]
"Your Python code keeps crashing with mysterious errors? 
In the next five minutes, you'll know exactly how to debug them."
```

#### Promise (0:10-0:20)
State exactly what viewers will learn/achieve:
```
"By the end of this video, you'll be able to:
- Read Python error messages like a pro
- Use three debugging tools that save hours
- Prevent these errors from happening again"
```

#### Content Delivery (Main Body)

**Progressive Disclosure Pattern:**
```
1. Context Setting (Why This Matters)
   "Here's why this breaks most people's code..."
   
2. Core Concept Introduction
   "The key insight is actually simple..."
   
3. Concrete Example
   "Let me show you exactly what I mean..."
   
4. Guided Practice
   "Now you try. Pause here and..."
   
5. Common Pitfalls
   "Watch out for this mistake..."
   
6. Advanced Application
   "Once you master the basics..."
```

#### Transitions That Work

Instead of formulaic transitions, use:
```
[SCENE CHANGE]
"Now here's where it gets interesting..."
"But wait - there's a problem..."
"OK so that handles X. What about Y?"
"You might be thinking... [address objection]"
```

### Educational Script Templates

#### Tutorial Script (5-10 minutes)
```
[HOOK - 10 seconds]
"[Problem statement or intriguing question]"

[PROMISE - 10 seconds]
"I'll show you [specific outcome] in [timeframe]"

[PROOF - 15 seconds]
"[Credibility statement or quick demo of result]"

[PART 1: FOUNDATION - 2 minutes]
- What is [concept]?
- Why does it matter?
- When do you use it?

[PART 2: DEMONSTRATION - 3 minutes]
- Step-by-step walkthrough
- Visual callouts
- Pause points for practice

[PART 3: PRACTICE - 2 minutes]
- Exercise for viewer

```

#### Lecture Script (20-45 minutes)

```
[OPENING CONTEXT - 2 minutes]
- Connect to previous knowledge
- State learning objectives
- Preview structure (not agenda)

[CONCEPT BLOCKS - 5-7 minutes each]

- Show complete picture
- Real-world application

[CLOSING - 2 minutes]
- Key takeaways
- Assignment/practice
- Preview next session
```

## Presentation Scripts

### Keynote/TEDx Structure

#### Opening (First 30 seconds)
Never start with:
- "Thank you for having me"
- "I'm honored to be here"
- "Today I want to talk about"

Instead start with:
- Provocative statement
- Surprising statistic
- Personal story moment
- Counter-intuitive claim

#### The Through-Line
Every presentation needs one core message. Everything supports this.

Structure:
```
1. SETUP (20% of time)
   - Establish the problem/opportunity
   - Make it personal to audience
   - Plant the seed of your idea

2. CONFRONTATION (60% of time)
   - Challenge conventional thinking
   - Present your core insight
   - Support with evidence/stories
   - Address objections

3. RESOLUTION (20% of time)
   - Show the new possibility
   - Give concrete next steps
   - End with memorable callback
```

### Pitch Script Format

#### The One-Minute Pitch
```
[PROBLEM - 15 seconds]
"You know how [target audience] struggles with [specific problem]?"

[SOLUTION - 15 seconds]
"We've built [solution] that [key benefit]."

[PROOF - 15 seconds]
"We've already [evidence of traction/validation]."

[ASK - 15 seconds]
"We're looking for [specific request] to [specific outcome]."
```

## Narrative Scripts

### Three-Act Structure for Short Content

#### Act 1: Setup (25%)
- Establish normal
- Introduce character/situation

- Stakes established

#### Act 2: Confrontation (50%)
- Rising action
- Obstacles and attempts
- Midpoint reversal
- Darkest moment

#### Act 3: Resolution (25%)
- Climax
- Falling action
- New normal
- Thematic resolution

### Documentary Script Format

```
[SCENE HEADING]

[NARRATION]
Write narration in normal paragraph form.
Keep sentences short. Make points clear.

[INTERVIEW SEGMENT]
SUBJECT NAME:
"Direct quote from interview transcript."

[B-ROLL NOTES]
Describe supporting visuals needed.

[LOWER THIRD]
Name, Title/Context

[TRANSITION]

```

## Podcast/Audio Scripts

### Solo Episode Structure

```
[COLD OPEN - 30 seconds]
Hook with best moment/insight from episode

[INTRO - 30 seconds]
"Welcome back to [show]. I'm [host].

Guest: [Name]
Topic: [Specific focus]
Goal: [What listeners should learn]

[INTRODUCTION OF GUEST]
Don't read bio. Instead:
"Today I'm talking with [name] who [relevant credibility].
[Name], [engaging first question]?"

[QUESTION FLOW]
Opening: Permission to be personal
"Before we dive into [expertise], can you tell us..."

Expertise: Get specific
"Walk me through exactly how you..."

Challenge: Create tension
"What's the biggest misconception about..."

Story: Make it real
"Can you share a time when..."

Future: Look ahead
"Where do you see this going..."

Closing: Give value
"If people remember one thing..."
```

## Voice and Tone Guidelines

### Matching Tone to Purpose

#### Educational Tone
- Encouraging but not condescending
- Clear but not simplistic
- Authoritative but not arrogant

Example Progression:
```
"This might seem complicated at first." (Acknowledge difficulty)
"Here's the simple version." (Provide access)
"Now let's add one more layer." (Build complexity)
"See? You've got it." (Affirm success)
```

#### Motivational Tone
- Direct but not aggressive
- Inspiring but not unrealistic
- Personal but not oversharing

#### Professional Tone
- Confident but not cocky
- Detailed but not boring
- Results-focused but not salesy

### Natural Dialogue Principles

#### Realistic Speech Patterns
Include (sparingly):
- "Um" and "uh" for authenticity (max 1-2 per minute)
- Self-corrections: "The data shows... actually, let me rephrase that"
- Thinking pauses: "..." or "[pause]"
- Natural emphases: "This is THE key insight"

#### Conversational Connectors
Replace formal transitions with:
- "So here's the thing..."
- "But actually..."
- "OK, now..."
- "And get this..."
- "The weird part is..."

## Script Formatting Standards

### Video Script Format
```
VIDEO                          | AUDIO
-------------------------------|----------------------------------
[Wide shot of speaker]         | SPEAKER: Welcome. Today we're 
                              | solving a problem that affects
                              | 90% of developers.
                              |
[Cut to screen recording]      | See this error message? You've
                              | probably seen it dozens of times.
                              |
[Zoom on error]               | But here's what it actually means...
```

### Two-Column Format (AV Scripts)
```
VISUAL                        | AUDIO/NARRATION
------------------------------|----------------------------------
FADE IN:                      | [MUSIC: Upbeat, fades under]
                             |
Title: "Python Debugging"     | NARRATOR: Your code is broken.
                             |
CUT TO: Screen recording     | But in the next five minutes,
showing error message        | you'll know exactly why.
```

### Notation Standards

**For emphasis:**
- CAPS for shouted words
- *Italics* for emphasized words
- ... for pauses
- — for interrupted speech
- [brackets] for actions/directions

**For timing:**
- (2 beat) for specific pauses
- [PAUSE] for natural break
- // for overlapping dialogue

## Revision and Polish

### Read-Aloud Test
Every script must pass the read-aloud test:
1. Read at performance speed
2. Mark tongue-twisters
3. Note breathing points
4. Identify unnatural phrases
5. Time each section

### Clarity Checklist
- [ ] Can each sentence be understood on first hearing?
- [ ] Are technical terms defined before use?
- [ ] Do pronouns have clear antecedents?
- [ ] Are lists varied in length (not always three)?
- [ ] Have you eliminated jargon and buzzwords?

### Engagement Checklist
- [ ] Hook within first 10 seconds?
- [ ] Promise clear value?
- [ ] Stories and examples throughout?
- [ ] Variation in pace and energy?
- [ ] Clear call-to-action?

### Natural Language Checklist
- [ ] Contractions used naturally?
- [ ] Sentences under 20 words?
- [ ] Active voice throughout?
- [ ] No AI clichés (see references)?
- [ ] Conversational transitions?

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Opening Pitfalls
❌ "In this comprehensive guide..."
✅ "Here's exactly how to..."

❌ "Let's delve into the fascinating world of..."
✅ "Let's break down..." or just start

❌ "Welcome to another episode where we'll explore..."
✅ "Today: [specific topic/question]"

### Transition Pitfalls
❌ "Now, let's move on to our next point..."
✅ "But here's where it gets interesting..."

❌ "It's important to note that..."
✅ Just state the important thing

❌ "With that being said..."
✅ "So..." or start new thought

### Closing Pitfalls
❌ "In conclusion, we've covered X, Y, and Z..."
✅ "The key thing to remember..."

❌ "I hope you found this helpful..."
✅ "Now you can..." [specific capability]

❌ "Thank you for watching/listening..."
✅ End with value, not gratitude
