## Quick Detection Test

Read your script aloud. If you hear yourself saying:
- Multiple em-dashes in one paragraph
- Lists of exactly three items repeatedly
- Any form of "delve"
- "Comprehensive" more than once
- Business buzzwords in non-business content
- Vague adjectives instead of specific descriptions
- The same transition phrase twice

**Your script needs human revision!**

## The Golden Rules

1. **Specific beats generic** - Say what you mean precisely
2. **Simple beats complex** - Use the shortest clear word
3. **Concrete beats abstract** - Give real examples
4. **Active beats passive** - Make subjects do things
5. **Natural beats formal** - Write like people talk
6. **Varied beats repetitive** - Mix up your patterns

## Emergency Word Replacements

When in doubt, use these simple alternatives:

| AI Word | Human Word |
|---------|------------|
| Utilize | Use |
| Implement | Start/Do |
| Leverage | Use |
| Optimize | Improve |
| Facilitate | Help |
| Endeavor | Try |
| Commence | Start |
| Terminate | End |
| Acquire | Get |
| Possess | Have |

Remember: If it sounds like a robot wrote it, it probably did. Read everything aloud!
