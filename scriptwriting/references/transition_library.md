## Avoiding Transition Pitfalls

### Never Use These Clichés
❌ "Without further ado..."
❌ "Having said that..."
❌ "At the end of the day..."
❌ "When all is said and done..."
❌ "It goes without saying..."
❌ "Needless to say..."
❌ "As I mentioned before..."
❌ "As previously stated..."
❌ "In conclusion..."
❌ "Last but not least..."

### Natural Transition Principles

1. **Keep it short** - 2-5 words usually enough
2. **Match the tone** - Formal content can use formal transitions
3. **Vary your transitions** - Don't repeat the same ones
4. **Use silence** - Sometimes no transition is best
5. **Be conversational** - Write like you talk
6. **Test out loud** - If it sounds weird spoken, change it

### Emergency Transitions (When Stuck)
- "So..."
- "Now..."
- "OK..."
- "Right..."
- "Well..."
- "And..."
- "But..."
- "Anyway..."
- "Actually..."
- "Also..."

These simple words often work better than complex transitions!
