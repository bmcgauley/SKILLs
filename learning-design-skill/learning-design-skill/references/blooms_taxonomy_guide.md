## Progressive Learning Design

### Scaffolding Through Levels

When designing a learning sequence, consider progression through Bloom's levels:

1. **Foundation Building (Remember/Understand)**
   - Start with terminology and concepts
   - Ensure comprehension before application
   - Use frequent knowledge checks

2. **Skill Development (Apply/Analyze)**
   - Introduce practical exercises
   - Provide guided practice
   - Gradually increase complexity

3. **Mastery Activities (Evaluate/Create)**
   - Integrate multiple concepts
   - Require critical thinking
   - Enable creative solutions

### Cognitive Load Considerations

**For Lower Levels (Remember/Understand):**
- Present information in small chunks
- Use visual aids and mnemonics
- Provide clear examples
- Minimize extraneous load

**For Middle Levels (Apply/Analyze):**
- Offer worked examples first
- Gradually fade scaffolding
- Provide practice opportunities
- Balance intrinsic load

**For Higher Levels (Evaluate/Create):**
- Encourage germane load
- Promote schema building
- Allow exploration
- Support transfer

## Writing Effective Objectives

### Formula
**Condition + Audience + Behavior + Degree**

### Examples by Level

**Remember:**
"Given a list of project management processes, learners will identify all five process groups with 100% accuracy."

**Understand:**
"After reviewing case studies, learners will explain the relationship between project scope and quality using specific examples."

**Apply:**
"Using project data, learners will calculate earned value metrics correctly for at least 4 out of 5 scenarios."

**Analyze:**
"Given a failed project case study, learners will analyze contributing factors and categorize them by knowledge area."

**Evaluate:**
"After reviewing competing proposals, learners will evaluate options using weighted criteria and justify their recommendation."

**Create:**
"By course end, learners will create a complete project charter that meets all PMI standard components."

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Using vague verbs:** Avoid "understand," "know," "learn," "appreciate"
2. **Level mismatch:** Don't assess at a different level than taught
3. **Skipping levels:** Build foundation before higher-order thinking
4. **One-size-fits-all:** Different learners may need different progressions
5. **Cognitive overload:** Too many objectives at high levels simultaneously
