## 1. Content Quality — "Low Value Content"

**The single most common rejection reason.** Google uses E-E-A-T framework to assess quality.

### What Counts as Low Value
- Thin content (few words, little original substance)
- Auto-generated or templated content
- Scraped content rewritten from other sources without adding value
- News aggregation without original commentary or analysis
- AI-generated content that lacks the author's original perspective, experience, or insight
- Doorway pages (created to rank for keywords, not serve users)
- Affiliate sites where the primary value is linking to products, not editorial content
- Pages with more ads than content

### What Google Wants
- Original content that users can't easily find elsewhere
- Content demonstrating real-world experience (E: Experience)
- Demonstrated expertise in the subject matter (E: Expertise)
- Recognition as a credible source by others (A: Authoritativeness)
- Accurate, honest, transparent content (T: Trustworthiness)

### YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) — Higher Bar
Sites covering finance, health, safety, or legal topics face stricter E-E-A-T requirements.

## 2. Prohibited Content (Automatic Disqualification)

- Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) — also illegal
- Violent content, gore
- Hate speech (race, ethnicity, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation)
- Harassment and bullying
- Hacking/cracking content
- Malware, adware, or unwanted software
- Illicit drugs and drug paraphernalia
- Content promoting violence against specific individuals or groups
- Content involving endangered species (sale/promotion)

## 3. Publisher Restrictions (Reduced Ad Delivery, Not Total Ban)

- Beer and hard alcohol sales
- Tobacco and tobacco-related products
- Prescription drug sales
- Firearms, ammunition, fighting knives, stun guns
- Coursework/essay mills (academic dishonesty services)
- Paid-to-click programs

## 4. Invalid Traffic and Ad Implementation

### Prohibited Behaviors
- Clicking your own ads (even accidentally)
- Asking others to click your ads
- Incentivizing clicks (rewards, promises)
- Using automated tools to generate clicks/impressions
- Placing ads in floating boxes
- Making ads indistinguishable from content
- Using misleading labels ("Favorite Sites" instead of "Advertisements")
- Placing arrows or graphics directing attention to ads
- Placing ads in emails, software, or pop-ups

### Valid Traffic Requirements
- Traffic must come from genuine user interest
- No paid traffic to ad pages unless it complies with Landing Page Quality Guidelines
- No traffic from software that triggers pop-ups or redirects

---

## 5. Site Navigation and User Experience

Google will reject sites with:
- Broken navigation or broken links
- Pages behind login/paywall where AdSense code is placed
- Redirects that confuse users
- Excessive pop-ups or dialers
- Pages "under construction"
- Sites difficult to navigate to find information

---

## 6. Required Trust Pages

For AdSense approval, sites need:
- **Privacy Policy** — Must disclose use of cookies and data collection
- **About** or equivalent page — Establishes who runs the site
- **Contact** page — Accessible way to reach the publisher

---

## 7. Copyright Requirements

- Publishers may not display ads alongside copyrighted content without permission
- This includes: displaying copyrighted articles, hosting copyrighted files, linking to sites with copyrighted material
- AI-generated content that may reproduce copyrighted training data is a risk

---

## 8. Affiliate Content Policy

- Sites primarily serving as affiliate portals (mostly product links, thin original content) will be rejected
- Affiliate content is acceptable only when it forms a minor part of a content-rich site
- The editorial content must add genuine value beyond the product links

---

## 9. Language Requirements

- Content must be primarily in a language supported by AdSense
- Supported languages include English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Japanese, and many others
- Mixed-language sites should submit the URL of the primary language section

---

## 10. Ad Placement Best Practices (Post-Approval)

- Maximum 3 ad units per page (for search pages)
- Ads must not outnumber content
- No floating box placements
- Ads above the fold should not push content below the fold excessively
- Label ad units correctly: "Sponsored Links" or "Advertisements" — never "Favorite Sites"
