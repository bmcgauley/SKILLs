# Audio Elements Guide

Comprehensive sound effect library organization and selection framework for video production master ledgers.

## Sound Effect Categories

### Movement SFX

Movement sounds accompany all visual motion and animation. They create audio-visual synchronization that doubles viewer engagement.

#### Whoosh Sounds
**When to Use:** Object movement, camera movement, transitions, slides
**Characteristics:**
- Light whoosh (0.2-0.5s): Small icons, text elements, subtle animations
- Medium whoosh (0.5-1.0s): B-roll transitions, medium graphics, standard slides
- Heavy whoosh (1.0-2.0s): Large graphics, dramatic transitions, major visual shifts

**Technical Specs:**
- Frequency range: 200-8000 Hz for clarity
- Volume: -15 to -10 dB relative to dialogue

- Frequency: Full spectrum with emphasis on 40-100 Hz and 2000-8000 Hz

**Layering Guidelines:**
1. Sub layer (40-100 Hz): Physical impact
2. Mid layer (200-2000 Hz): Body and presence  
3. High layer (4000-12000 Hz): Clarity and shimmer

## Sound Effect Timing Principles

### Frame Accuracy Standards

**Critical Timing (Must be frame-perfect):**
- Pop sounds with visual appearances
- Hit sounds with visual impacts
- Click sounds with interface interactions
- Initial attack of risers

**Near-Accurate Timing (Within 2-3 frames acceptable):**
- Whoosh sounds with motion starts
- Ambient fades
- Drone fade-ins

**Flexible Timing (Can lead or lag visual):**
- Ambient backgrounds (continuous)
- Long drones (atmospheric)
- Reverb tails

### Synchronization Techniques

**Visual-First Sync:**
1. Place visual element on timeline
2. Identify exact frame of key moment (appearance, impact, etc.)
3. Place SFX attack on same frame
4. Adjust SFX volume for moment importance

**Audio-First Sync:**
1. Place SFX on timeline
2. Note peak/attack frame
3. Align visual element to match
4. Fine-tune both for perfect sync

## Volume Automation Strategies

### Dynamic Range Management

**Dialogue Priority:**
- Dialogue: Reference at -6 to -3 dB peak
- Music: -18 to -12 dB during dialogue
- SFX Movement: -15 to -10 dB
- SFX Emphasis: -10 to -6 dB
- SFX Emotional: -25 to -8 dB (varies)
- Ambient: -35 to -25 dB

**Music Priority (No dialogue):**
- Music: -6 to -3 dB peak
- SFX Movement: -12 to -8 dB
- SFX Emphasis: -8 to -3 dB
- SFX Emotional: -20 to -5 dB
- Ambient: -30 to -22 dB

### Automation Curves

**Fade Types:**
- Linear: Standard fades, predictable
- Exponential: Natural sounding, organic
- S-curve: Smooth, professional transitions
- Logarithmic: Quick fades, urgent moments

**Fade Durations:**
- Ultra-quick: 0.1-0.3s (sudden changes)
- Quick: 0.3-0.8s (standard transitions)
- Medium: 0.8-2.0s (topic changes)
- Slow: 2.0-5.0s (major shifts)

## Common Sound Design Patterns

### Pattern: Reveal Sequence
**Structure:**
1. Riser (1-2s) building anticipation
2. Pop (0.1s) as element appears
3. Hit (0.3s) for emphasis
4. Settle (whoosh tail 0.5s)

**Total Duration:** 2-3s
**Use for:** Important reveals, key information, dramatic moments

### Pattern: Transition Sequence
**Structure:**
1. Swipe (0.2s) as current content exits
2. Whoosh (0.8s) during transition
3. Pop (0.1s) as new content appears
4. Ambient shift (1s fade)

**Total Duration:** 2s
**Use for:** Topic changes, segment boundaries, mode shifts

### Pattern: Build and Release
**Structure:**
1. Drone enters (2s fade-in) establishing atmosphere
2. Drone sustains (5-10s) building tension
3. Riser overlaps (last 2s) intensifying
4. Hit (0.3s) releasing tension
5. Silence or calm music (2s) for resolution

**Total Duration:** 9-14s
**Use for:** Dramatic story beats, problem-solution moments, reveals

### Pattern: Layered Emphasis
**Structure:**
1. Pop (0.1s) for visual appearance
2. Whoosh (0.5s) adding movement dimension
3. Hit (0.3s) emphasizing importance
4. Reverb tail (1s) adding space

**Total Duration:** 2s with overlap
**Use for:** Maximum emphasis on critical moments

## Sound Effect Selection Decision Tree

```
Is there visual motion?
├─ YES: Use Movement SFX
│   ├─ Quick motion (< 0.5s)? → Light whoosh or swipe
│   ├─ Medium motion (0.5-1.5s)? → Medium whoosh or slide
│   └─ Slow motion (> 1.5s)? → Heavy whoosh or slide
│
└─ NO: Is something appearing/being emphasized?
    ├─ YES: Use Emphasis SFX
    │   ├─ Gentle emphasis? → Soft pop
    │   ├─ Strong emphasis? → Sharp pop or hit
    │   └─ Interface interaction? → Click
    │
    └─ NO: Does moment need emotional manipulation?
        ├─ YES: Use Emotional SFX
        │   ├─ Building tension? → Riser
        │   ├─ Releasing tension? → Hit
        │   └─ Maintaining atmosphere? → Drone
        │
        └─ NO: Does B-roll need environmental context?
            └─ YES: Use Ambient SFX matching environment
```

## Integration with Music

### Frequency Coordination

**Music occupies:**
- Sub-bass: 20-60 Hz
- Bass: 60-250 Hz
- Mids: 250-4000 Hz
- Highs: 4000-20000 Hz

**SFX frequency placement:**
- Avoid direct conflict with music in same range
- Use EQ to carve space for both elements
- Emphasize SFX in frequencies music is weaker
- Drop music volume 3-6 dB during major SFX

### Rhythmic Coordination

- Align hits with music beats when possible
- Use music gaps for prominent SFX
- Sync risers to musical builds
- Match SFX density to music energy level

## Conclusion

Effective sound design creates a second sensory channel for engagement, doubling viewer immersion. By systematically applying movement, emphasis, emotional, and ambient sounds according to these guidelines, production master ledgers ensure audio enhances rather than competes with visuals, creating a cohesive, professional viewing experience that maximizes retention and impact.
