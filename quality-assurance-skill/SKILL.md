## Best Practices

### Quality Planning Best Practices

1. **Prevention Over Detection:** Build quality in rather than inspect it out
2. **Early and Often:** Start QA activities from project initiation
3. **Risk-Based Approach:** Focus efforts on high-risk areas
4. **Clear Standards:** Define quality criteria upfront
5. **Stakeholder Agreement:** Get buy-in on quality expectations

### Review Best Practices

1. **Small Chunks:** Review manageable portions at a time
2. **Fresh Eyes:** Use reviewers not involved in creation
3. **Preparation Time:** Allow adequate review preparation
4. **Focus on Issues:** Separate defect finding from fixing
5. **Constructive Feedback:** Maintain professional, helpful tone

### Testing Best Practices

1. **Independent Testing:** Separate testers from developers
2. **Test Early:** Begin testing as soon as possible
3. **Automate Repetitive Tests:** Use automation for regression
4. **Test Data Management:** Maintain realistic test data
5. **Environment Parity:** Test environment matches production

### Defect Management Best Practices

1. **Clear Documentation:** Provide reproducible steps
2. **Proper Classification:** Use consistent severity levels
3. **Root Cause Focus:** Address causes not just symptoms
4. **Timely Resolution:** Fix critical issues immediately
5. **Verification Required:** Always verify fixes work

### Continuous Improvement Best Practices

1. **Data-Driven Decisions:** Base improvements on metrics
2. **Small Increments:** Make gradual changes
3. **Team Involvement:** Engage everyone in improvement
4. **Document Changes:** Update processes and procedures
5. **Celebrate Success:** Recognize improvement achievements

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Late Quality Focus:** Starting QA only at project end
